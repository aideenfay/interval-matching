# README - Persistent Cohomological Cycle Matching

This repository contains the code for the Persistent Cohomological Cycle Matching approach developed in the paper ["Fast Topological Signal Identification and Persistent Cohomological Cycle Matching" (García-Redondo, Monod, and Song 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15446).

This code is available and is fully adaptable for individual user customization. If you use the our methods, please cite as the following:
